[12:13, 10/09/2023] +91 86082 78358: Install the CloudWatch Logs agent on your EC2 instance using the following command:

create a IAM Role -> AWS SERVICE -> EC2 with CloudwatchFullAccess

Create a Amazon Linux 2 AMI 5.10 - EC2 instance, Attach above IAM role to EC2

Connect instance and run below commands to install cloudwatch logs

sudo -i
sudo yum install -y awslogs

Edit the CloudWatch Logs agent configuration file nano /etc/awslogs/awslogs.conf using your preferred text editor.

In the configuration file, define a log file to monitor and the log group and log stream where the logs should be sent. For example:

[/var/log/messages]
datetime_format = %b %d %H:%M:%S
file = /var/log/messages
buffer_duration = 5000
log_stream_name = {instance_id}
initial_position = start_of_file
log_group_name = MyDemoCWDLogs

By default, the nano /etc/awslogs/awscli.conf points to the us-east-1 Region. To push your logs to a different Region, edit the awscli.conf file and specify that Region.

Start the CloudWatch Logs agent using the following command:

sudo systemctl start awslogsd

That's it! The CloudWatch Logs agent will now start sending logs from the specified log file to the CloudWatch Logs group and stream you specified in the configuration file

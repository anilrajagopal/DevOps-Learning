End to End HandsOn project
 
1) Setup Jenkins (Using Docker Container YAML)
2) Setup Selenium Grid (Using Kubernetes YAML)
3) Deploy the dev (using development dockerfile) and one for QA (for automation of dev)
    a) Change the IPs and Port for configs
    b) Run it locally
    c) Push it your git repo (main) and note the URL
4) Setup a webhook with Jenkins Job and GIT
5) Setup a Jenkins Pipeline to do the following
    a) Webhook Job to trigger the Pipeline
    b) Stage 1: Pull the dev code and deploy as container and confirm up and running
    c) Stage 2: Setup SonarQube and run the static checks
    d) Stage 3: Pull the QA code and run smoke test against dev server in se grid (1 browser and 1 max instance)
       - Push the results to S3
    e) Post: Send email end of the pipeline
    
// Before 11.30 --> Target to complete this !! 

6) Build HPA (50% Memory and limit) for scaling pods using YAML
7) Create Jenkins Pipeline to run sanity tests (now or on schedule) where it will run 8 tests (4 parallel threads)
   - Confirm scaling happens
8) Setup Prometheus and Grafana for the Selenium Kubernetes Pods to monitor and visualize
9) Run the regressions tests (16 tests) with 8 parallel threads and confirm the alert for new pods email is sent

Notes about XVFB Uninstall

If xvfb was installed in your ubuntu and available in your PATH, the type command would provide a result else, it would not.

The alternate option to confirm if it is installed or not, use the following to check the package manager

dpkg -l | grep xvfb

and if this does not returns, then install as usual.

Hope this clarifies !!

--------------------------

------Steps:

1) Setup Selenium Grid in your VM as Docker Compose
2) Setup Selenium Scripts in your local Eclipse/IntelliJ
3) Change Grid IP and Dev IP in your local code base
4) Run 1 or more tests from local and confirm tests ran fine (check reports)
5) Once all code looks great, push to repo
6) Go to VM, git clone and run as maven test from VM to confirm test is good
7) Create docker file for selenium tests (including AWS S3 Push)
8) Test docker container to confirm all tests ran fine and results are in S3
9) Setup Jenkins Pipeline to call docker run (image) with arg

Finally, developer webhook should trigger your pipeline
